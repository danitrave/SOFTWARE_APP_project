# SOFTWARE_APP_project
This is the code that my team and I developed when I was attending the second year of university for a course called "Software application"
This project contains different scripts and directories that should be placed in a unique directory in the way they are reported here. 
Before running the program, one should read the fine "project_document.pdf" since it provides a very detailed description of the project that has been developed. Notice that the project has been created in a group team containing 4 people. 
The main file that hasty be run is the script called "project.py". 
The other scripts are supplementary functions.
